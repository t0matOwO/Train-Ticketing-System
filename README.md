# Train-Ticketing-System
An introductory OOP-based project in C++ that simulates a train ticketing system where potential passengers can register as users to view train routes and schedules and then book or cancel tickets to the trips they want to take.


The script contains 5 classes (Passenger, Ticket, Train, Route, ReservationSystem) with varying functions and variables defined within them. 


Passenger: contains the username and password;

Ticket: contains the passenger name, train schedule, train number, route number;

Train: contains the train number, route number, train schedule, total seats;

Route: contains the route number, departure and arrival points, distance;

ReservationSystem: declares and runs all the variables and functions.
